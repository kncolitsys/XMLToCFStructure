The CFC includes a single function that converts XML to a Coldfusion structure.
I have tested the code with upto 5 levels of nested XML but theoretically there is no limit on that.

The usage is pretty simple. 
 Step 1 - Read a XML file into a CF variable
 Step 2 - pass on the CF var to the function
 
 Read the usage.cfm for an example.
 
 
ENJOY!
